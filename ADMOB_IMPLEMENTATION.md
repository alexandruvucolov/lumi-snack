```

### Test Mode:
- Set `USE_TEST_ADS = true` in `constants/ads.ts` for development
- Set `USE_TEST_ADS = false` for production builds

## üì± Testing Instructions

### Development Testing (with test ads):
1. Set `USE_TEST_ADS = true` in `constants/ads.ts`
2. Run: `npm start` or `npx expo start`
3. Test in Expo Go (limited ad functionality)

### Production Testing (with real ads):
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Real ads require a development build, NOT Expo Go

1. Set `USE_TEST_ADS = false` in `constants/ads.ts`
2. Build development build:
   ```bash
   # For Android
   eas build --profile development --platform android
   
   # For iOS
   eas build --profile development --platform ios
   ```
3. Install the development build on your device
4. Test all three ad types:
   - Banner ad on home screen
   - Interstitial ad after 3rd game over
   - Rewarded ad "continue" feature

## üéØ Key Features
